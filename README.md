# MOBILE-PRICE-CLASSIFICATION

# Business Overview

The increasing use of smartphones is evident in the world today. For mobile dealers, an effective pricing strategy is essential for continued sales success. It is important to have a carefully planned pricing strategy.

Smartphone prices can be affected by a wide range of factors, such as brand and the length of time a particular device has been on the market. The ability to use a device internationally can also affect its price. If a device has a high-resolution camera and a lot of storage capacity, it will likely cost more than a unit without less notable capabilities. Those individuals who are willing to enter a contract, however, may be able to get a smartphone loaded with desirable features at a bargain price.

# Business Objectives

Based on the features of the phone,  we build a machine learning model that predicts its price.
